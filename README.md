#### Public endpoints
- [/oauth](docs/endpoint-oauth.md) (Authentication endpoint)

#### Protected endpoint

All the endpoints listed below are protected and require authentication with an access token.
This token must be issued from the oauth endpoint (see documentation above).
This token must be passed in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer`.

- [/users](docs/endpoint-users.md) (Users endpoint)

#### Hooks

Hooks allows your app to subscribe to LVConnect events, making sure that your user database is up to date with LVConnect.

- [See the documentation](docs/hooks.md)

#### Usage in your project
Some adapters are available for: 

- [Nodejs Passport](https://github.com/mathieutu/lvconnect-passport)
- [PHP Laravel](https://github.com/mathieutu/lvconnect-socialite)

## Installation

You will need to have on your machine:
- [Redis](http://redis.io/) (>3.x)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (>3.x.x)

If you have docker, you can launch directly theses services with `docker-compose up`.

Then run in your cloned folder:
```shell
yarn
```

If you want to work on this project, run:
```shell
yarn dev
```

Or if you want the production mode:
```shell
node .
```

The server listens to `localhost:8000` in dev, `lvconnect.herokuapp.com` in staging and`lvconnect.link-value.fr` in production.

## Configuration

The project requires a local configuration file containing Slack, Trello and Github API tokens.
These config keys are not committed for security reasons, since they provide full access to target account.
The required keys are:

```js
module.exports = {
  trello: {
    apiKey: '',
    apiToken: '',
  },
  github: {
    apiToken: '',
  },
  slack: {
    apiToken: '',
  },
  mailjet: {
    apiKey: '',
    apiToken: '',
  },
};
```

This config file should be saved in `config` folder under the name `local.js` or `local.json`.

## Deployment

LvConnect uses automatic deploy through CircleCI deploys. Staging environment is auto-deployed on each commit made upon master branch. 
Production environment release is auto-built upon tags on master branch, the build will have to be deployed manually by going into the CircleCI workflow of the build and triggering the deploy job.

To tag a release for production, use the `npm version` command which will bump version in package.json and generate the CHANGELOG.md file automatically.

## CLI

LVConnect has a command line interface to help you do quick tasks. To run the cli, use the following command:

```shell
./packages/api/bin/cli.js [command] [...options]
```

Here's the command help (you can also access it by using the `--help` option):

```
Usage: cli [options] [command]


  Commands:

    create-superuser           Creates admin user with admin@link-value.fr/admin

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
```
