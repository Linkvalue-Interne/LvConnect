Feature: OAuth authentication

  LVConnect should provide a way to authenticate from any app with an authorization process.

  Scenario: OAuth authorization from scratch
    Given I'm using fresh database

    When I visit the "authorize app" page
    And I type "benjamin.delamarre@link-value.fr" in "login email input"
    And I type "test1234" in "login password input"
    And I click the "login submit"
    Then I should see "oauth permissions list"
    And page should contain "2" "oauth permissions list item"
    And I should read "Visionner votre profil" in "oauth permissions list item" number "1"
    And I should read "Modification de votre profil" in "oauth permissions list item" number "2"

    When I click the "oauth permissions submit"
    Then I should be on "oauth callback" page
    And I should read "Test app" in "oauth callback app name"
    And I should read "Successfully" in "oauth callback auth code status"
